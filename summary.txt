So my app is going to be a financial tracker app. It will bascially track your income and expense transactions. It will also categorize them and generate summarys. Users will be able to track how much each category generates. So far I've completed one file being the Transaction file and I've partially started another. I plan to finish my second file which will contain an ArrayList and a stack along with a hashmap. And then get started on my main file.
